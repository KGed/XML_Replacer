# XML_Replacer (WIP)

Python script to change specific nodes in a folder of XML files (Can also be used to change data in a single file, but is fairly unnecessary). Currently, you have to change the input data in the file, but I'm planning on making it take a text file as its input.

Planned Features:
- "Find" and replace feature, to prevent replacing node data in certain places
- Text file input (get input on what to change)
- Command line input
